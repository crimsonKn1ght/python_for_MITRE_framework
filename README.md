# python_for_PRE-ATTACK

### The MITRE Pre-ATT&CK matrix comprises of two tactics:
### 1. Reconaissance
### 2. Resource Development

We would be using python to implement the attacks related to recon using scripts to scan a target for ports and also enumerate it's DNS servers. This can lead to revealing of other IP ranges in the organization and thus we complete the onjective of the recon tactic by discovering more info on the target org.
