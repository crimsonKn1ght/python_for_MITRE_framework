# python_for_PRE-ATTACK

**MITRE ATT&CK** (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a knowledge base that describes the actions and behaviors of cyber adversaries.

### The MITRE Pre-ATT&CK matrix comprises of two tactics:
### 1. Reconaissance

During reconnaissance, threat actors aim to collect intelligence on potential targets, identifying vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and valuable assets. This phase is divided into two main categories: passive reconnaissance and active reconnaissance.

* #### Passive Reconnaissance:

Information Gathering: Adversaries collect information without directly interacting with the target. This includes analyzing publicly available data, social media, WHOIS databases, and other open sources.
Footprinting: Attackers create a blueprint of the target's network infrastructure, identifying domain names, IP addresses, and network services.
Active Reconnaissance:

* #### Scanning and Enumeration:

Adversaries actively probe the target's systems to identify live hosts, open ports, and services. This involves techniques like port scanning and network enumeration.
Vulnerability Scanning: Threat actors search for vulnerabilities in the target's systems or applications that can be exploited in later stages of the attack.

### 2. Resource Development

We would be using python to implement the attacks related to recon using scripts to scan a target for ports and also enumerate it's DNS servers. This can lead to revealing of other IP ranges in the organization and thus we complete the onjective of the recon tactic by discovering more info on the target org.
